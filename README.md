# Trgan Report

TrganReport is a lightweight, modular automation reporting framework built for speed, scalability, and visual clarity in HTML. Whether you're tracking test outcomes or visualizing domain-specific data, TrganReport delivers structured, branded reports with precision.

## Report Structure
A typical TrganReport output breaks down into five key sections: 

- **Summary Panel** providing high-level test metrics (total, passed, failed, skipped, duration)
- **Metadata** containing contextual details such as execution date, environment, mode, executor, and sprint
- **Execution Status** table detailing each container or testâ€™s start and end times, duration, and status
- **Execution Outcome**(optional) table for visualizing domain-specific results or data mappings
- **Execution Report** with nested containers, tests, steps, and logs for full traceability
